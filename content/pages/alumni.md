## Learn About Our Rich 50-Year History

## New Theatre History Project

The New Theatre History Project is an archive of every show, committee, member and publicity material since the start of student theatre at the University of Nottingham. Our current information suggests that the Nottingham Dramatic Society formed in 1927 – this means that we have a history which spans almost 90 years!

An archive such as this is completely unique among both student and professional theatres in this country. We haven't found a single other theatre which offers such an extensive, vibrant and interactive online archive.
