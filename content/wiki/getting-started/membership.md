## Welcome to the Nottingham New Theatre

Have you ever wondered what it would be like to rig lights in a theatre? Ever toyed with the idea of directing a play? Pondered what it might be like to get up on stage in front of hundreds of people? Longed to design and build an entire set? 

The Nottingham New Theatre is one of the biggest student-run groups at Nottingham, and the only student-run theatre in England. **With fifteen shows a semester, and dedicated casts and crews for each, there's an opportunity for everyone!**

## Getting Your Membership

Membership benefits include discounted tickets to all shows, ability to audition for and participate in productions, access to workshops and training sessions, invitations to social events and networking opportunities, and access to our equipment and rehearsal spaces.

## Season Launches - Your Best Starting Point

Season Launches are the best opportunity to see all of the roles available in our shows for that season. You will find out what plays are in the season, and they'll all be looking for actors, technicians, designers, builders, and so on.
