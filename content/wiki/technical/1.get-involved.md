Technical theatre at the New Theatre offers exciting opportunities to work with professional-grade equipment and develop valuable practical skills. Whether you're interested in lights, sound, video, or just want to learn something new, there's a place for you on our tech team.

## Welcome to Tech!

With all those pretty lights, sound effects, and fancy videos, someone's got to be in charge of it and that could be you.

We've got a large and modern stock of [technical equipment](https://newtheatre.org.uk/technical/#equipment) that is ever expanding, so there's plenty to sink your teeth into.

Throughout the year, we run extensive training on how to use our equipment, as well as creative workshops from industry professionals on lighting or sound design.

Being part of the tech team is super rewarding, and you get to be involved with as many productions as you want. You will be working with directors, actors, and set designers to create a spectacular production with lots of fun along the way.

## Getting Started

**No experience required!** Just enthusiasm and willingness to learn. We provide full training on all equipment and safety procedures.

### First Steps

Join our [Tech Facebook Group](http://facebook.com/groups/nnt.tech) where all opportunities are posted. Sign up as an Operator which is a great entry point to learn how shows work. Attend training workshops - we run regular training sessions throughout the year. Contact the Technical Manager with any questions.

## Technical Roles Available

### Operators
The perfect starting point! Operators sit at the tech desk with the Technical Director to run the show. They press the 'Go' button to fire any lighting, sound or video cues during the show.

This role is great for beginners with full training provided. You'll learn how shows work by seeing the whole production process. Sign ups are posted weekly in the Tech Facebook group, and you have flexible commitment - choose which shows to work on.

### Technical Director (TD)
The Technical Director oversees all the technical aspects of a show, such as rigging, focusing, and organising. They run the technical rehearsals and are often found shouting "Stop!" just before a climactic moment.

Responsibilities include making sure all tech elements get done on time, 'calling the show' (following the script and cueing operators/stage managers), coordinating between all technical departments, and running technical rehearsals and show calls.

### Lighting Designer (LD)
Using [lights, colours, smoke and haze](https://newtheatre.org.uk/technical/#lighting) is the domain of the lighting designer. As a lighting designer, you'll work with the rest of the creative team to create the 'look' of the show.

The process involves meeting with the director to understand their vision, creating a lighting plan (diagram showing where lights go and what colours they'll be), leading rigging during get-in (supervised by the TD), focusing the lights by pointing them in the right direction, and plotting the show by programming the cues into the lighting desk.

### Sound Designer (SD)
Some shows want sound effects, others want underscores, and some even benefit from composition work - all of which fall under sound design.

We've got [many speakers](https://newtheatre.org.uk/technical/#sound) that sound designers can use to tackle designs from small to large scale, with shows using up to 7 speakers for a fully immersive soundscape.

The process involves meeting with the director and often watching rehearsals, planning speaker placement by deciding where you can (or can't) put speakers, installing speakers during get-in and focusing them, and programming the show to realize your design using QLab or other software.

### Video Designer
A stunning video design can help a show really stand out. We can do anything from projecting onto a screen at the back of the stage to unique mapping around smaller set pieces, whatever your imagination can come up with.

You might use premade content (TV clips, existing videos), create original hand-drawn backdrops or animations, design interactive video elements, or create immersive projection environments.

The process involves rigging projectors and screens during get-in, focusing projectors by pointing them in the right place, mapping content to make the image fill the surface properly, and programming the show to make the content appear at the right times.
