## New Writing at the NNT

Without playwrights, we'd have nothing to put on the New Theatre stage. New writing has been as much a part of our success as published plays and you can be a part of that.

Our writing differentiates us from other student theatres across the country, and all of the shows we take to Edinburgh are brand new for the Festival!

You can put your writing on the stage in any of our seasons, and we're eager to see your work.

> "Playwriting at the New Theatre is the best way to flex your writing muscles. At the NNT, I've been given the opportunity to stretch myself with structure, plot, dialogue, character, and setting. Seeing your work on stage can be nerve-wracking, but it's an invaluable and thrilling experience."
>
> "It feels so invigorating to be writing in an environment where lots of other students are writing plays – sometimes very similar, sometimes very different, to your own."

## How to Get Your Play on Stage

### Step 1: Write a Draft
This is the most important step - we need to see a play with a beginning, middle, and end to be able to consider it. It can still be a work in progress, but it needs to be a complete story.

**What Makes a Good Draft:**
- Clear story structure with beginning, middle, and end
- Developed characters with distinct voices
- Stage-worthy dialogue and action
- Appropriate length for your chosen season
- Awareness of staging possibilities and limitations

### Step 2: Find a Director
You have options:
- **Direct your own work** - Many writers enjoy bringing their own vision to life
- **Find another director** - Fresh perspective can enhance your work
- **Collaborate from the start** - Some writer-director partnerships begin before the script is finished

### Step 3: Get It Read
The best way to improve your script is to get people to read it.

### Step 4: Propose Your Play
Once you're ready, follow our standard proposal process:
- Check the [proposing guide](/wiki/productions/proposing) for full details
- Consider which season best suits your work
- Prepare to discuss your vision and development process
- Be ready to talk about practical staging requirements
