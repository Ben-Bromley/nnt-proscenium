## The Marketing Team

Marketing and publicity is an integral part of any show, working primarily with the producer to make sure everyone knows about the production. There are two key roles in show marketing:

### Publicity Manager
Being the publicity manager for a show means taking charge of getting the word out about your production.

### Poster Designer
If you're a bit of an artist, poster design might be perfect for you. Poster design takes many forms: illustrations, paintings, photography, graphic design - and sometimes all of them together.
