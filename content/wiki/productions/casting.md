## Welcome All Actors

At the New Theatre, we welcome all actors to be in up to two plays per semester and want to give as many opportunities to tread our boards. Whether you've never acted before, were the sheep in your Nativity, have done some school acting, are a seasoned pro at the RSC — or simply just dabble — please come along and audition.

## How Auditions Work

Each season holds open auditions over 2 days, and **anyone can audition for free**. Here's what to expect:

### The Audition Process

**Arrive at the audition venue** and head to the audition room (or the theatre foyer if you're not sure). **Collect your piece** - you'll be given a piece of text. Take this away and become familiar with it (most people take around 10-15 minutes). **Perform for the team** - come back and perform it. You don't need to learn it, just give it your best shot. **That's it!** Take a rest before heading to your next audition.

### Top Tips for Success

Sign up and audition for everything — provided you can do the show dates, of course! This means you will get more experience of auditions and stand a greater chance of being cast in a play. Don't worry about perfection - we're looking for potential and enthusiasm, not flawless performances. Be yourself - authenticity is more valuable than trying to be what you think we want.

## The Casting Timeline

**Auditions** are usually held over 2 days. **Callbacks** happen the weekend after auditions - some actors may be called back for specific roles. **Casting decisions** are made over the weekend after auditions. **Results** are communicated to all auditionees about casting decisions.

## Casting Policy

### Our Commitment to Inclusive Casting

We aim to cast shows to reflect the diversity of our membership. Roles are open to all unless specifically required by the script. We encourage innovative and inclusive interpretations of characters, and directors work with the casting team to ensure fair and transparent processes.

### What Happens After Auditions

Directors discuss all auditionees with the casting team. Callbacks may be held for specific roles where directors want to see more. Casting meetings take place where final decisions are made. Results are communicated to all auditionees, whether successful or not.

### If You're Cast

Congratulations! You'll receive confirmation of your role(s), contact details for your director and production team, first rehearsal details, and important dates for your production.

### If You're Not Cast This Time

Don't be discouraged! This is completely normal and happens to everyone. There are usually more talented auditionees than available roles, different shows need different types of performers, so keep auditioning - persistence pays off. Consider getting involved in other ways such as technical or production roles.
