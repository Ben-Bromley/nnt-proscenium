## Getting Started with Directing

Directing is full of challenges and great fun for anyone at the New Theatre. You can propose any play you like - innovation and new writing are encouraged.

Anything you can think of, we can stage: whether it's physical, in the round, absurd, or in some weird building in the middle of town — we'd love to hear your ideas.

> "Directing at the Nottingham New Theatre has been a brilliant and life-changing experience, but don't worry, there's so much support every step of the way. Directing at the NNT has meant working closely with some of the most talented people I've ever met – from actors, to sound and lighting designers, to brilliant stage managers. My advice to anyone thinking of proposing is – do it!"

## How to Put On a Play

### Step 1: Decide on the Play
It's totally up to you! You can put on a play you've loved reading, watching, or being a part of elsewhere, or an original work. New writing and innovative adaptations are particularly encouraged.

### Step 2: Decide on the Season
We have four seasons that you can propose for, each with their own characteristics to consider:

- **In House Season:** Our main season in the 86-seat Auditorium with longer runs and higher profile productions.

- **Studio Season:** Intimate productions in our 30-seat studio spaces, perfect for experimental or challenging work.

- **Edinburgh Fringe Season:** Shows that will travel to Edinburgh Festival, competing with thousands of other productions.

- **External Season:** Productions in alternative venues around Nottingham, offering creative freedom and unique opportunities.

Have a think about which season is best for your show before you propose!

### Step 3: Check the Rights
It needs to be possible to get the rights to put the play on. The company to contact is usually written in the first few pages of the script. Consider the cost of rights, availability for your dates, any restrictions, and remember that original plays don't need rights but may need development time.

### Step 4: Fill in the Proposal Form
<!-- TODO: Update with current proposal form links -->
You'll need to fill in either the **In House Proposals Form** or **Studio Proposals Form** and submit it to the relevant Season Coordinator by email before the deadline.

**Form Requirements:**
The Proposal Form must be used exactly with no modification to questions, and word limits must be adhered to. Draft it in Word or Google Docs and then paste it into the form - this is very useful if you're working as a team.

### Step 5: Proposal Day
Come to the proposal day for a 15-minute Q&A from the committee. You can propose on your own or as a team (typically a director-producer pair). After presenting and answering questions, the committee discusses and you'll be phoned later that day with the decision.

## What the Committee Looks For

### Artistic Vision
Show a clear concept and interpretation of the material with understanding of the themes and their relevance. Creative and innovative approaches are welcomed, but demonstrate that you understand the play's requirements.

### Technical Considerations
Provide a realistic assessment of technical needs with understanding of our venues' capabilities and limitations. Consider budget requirements and ensure safety and practical feasibility.

### Marketing Ideas
Understand your target audience and have ideas for how to promote the show. Show awareness of what makes your production unique and consider broader appeal beyond the immediate theatre community.

### Practical Elements
Present a realistic rehearsal and production schedule with understanding of cast and crew requirements. Show awareness of your own experience and support needs, and demonstrate flexibility and a problem-solving approach.

## Choosing a Play and Rights

### Rights and Royalties
Always check rights before proposing by contacting the publisher or rights holder. Budget for royalty fees which can range from £50 to several hundred pounds. Check availability for your dates as popular shows may be booked out, understand any restrictions as some plays have specific casting or staging requirements, and get written confirmation rather than relying on verbal agreements.

### Where to Find Plays
Published play collections are available in libraries and bookshops. Online databases from many publishers have searchable catalogues. Ask for recommendations from other directors and committee members, look at festival programmes to see what other student theatres are doing, and connect with new writing networks to find emerging playwrights.

## After Your Proposal is Accepted
