## What is a Producer?

Are you an on-the-ball sort of person? Do you relish a job well done? Have you got what it takes to organise and manage the staging of an entire production? Not sure? The one way to find out is to produce a show!

A producer is responsible for delivering a good show, on time and on budget. They are the organisational powerhouse, doing everything from booking rooms for rehearsals to getting rights from publishers.

> "My favourite part of producing is finding the most cost-effective (and sometimes safest!) ways to bring to life the vision of the director. It allows you to be creative as well as presenting the challenge of thinking on your feet."

> "You are the glue holding everything together (sometimes quite literally) both on and off stage!"

## Key Responsibilities

### Pre-Production
Secure performance rights and music licenses, create and maintain production budgets, arrange rehearsal rooms and performance spaces, help the director assemble their creative team, and create and maintain production timelines.

### During Rehearsals
Find solutions to unexpected challenges, ensure all departments have what they need, keep everyone informed of important updates, track expenses and prevent overspend, and prepare for potential issues.

### Technical Week and Performances
Work with box office and ushers on front of house coordination, ensure all elements are ready for opening, be available to handle any issues that arise during shows, and manage returns, strike, and final accounting.

## How to Get Involved

### Finding a Show to Produce
Talk to proposing directors before proposals and join forces. Attend Season Launch events to find out who's looking for a producer. Express interest to season coordinators who can match you with directors. Start small - Studio shows can be great for first-time producers.

### Skills You'll Develop
Project management through planning and coordinating complex productions, budget management with financial planning and cost control, communication by liaising between different departments and people, problem solving with creative solutions to practical challenges, and leadership by supporting and motivating your production team.

## Working with Your Director

The director-producer partnership is crucial to a show's success:

The **director focuses on** artistic vision and creative decisions, working with actors and creative team, rehearsal process and character development, and overall aesthetic and interpretation.

The **producer focuses on** practical implementation of the vision, budget, schedule, and resource management, communication and coordination, and problem-solving and contingency planning.

**Together you** make creative decisions that balance artistic vision with practical constraints.
